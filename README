String::Multibyte - locale-independent manipulation
of multibyte character strings

SYNOPSIS

  use String::Multibyte
  $sjis = String::Multibyte->new('ShiftJIS');
  $sjis_length = $sjis->length($sjis_string);

DESCRIPTION

This module provides some functions which emulate
the corresponding CORE:: functions
to manipulate multiple-byte character strings.

This module uses the object-oriented syntax to tell methods
in which charset the specified strings should be handled.

PREREQUISITES AND INSTALLATION

Perl 5.003 or later.

Exception:
    String::Multibyte::Unicode is for Perl 5.8.0 or later.
    Some tests provided for String::Multibyte will be skipped
    silently on an older Perl.

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Note: t/long.t does stress tests to cope with long strings.
     If it takes long long time on your machine,
     try again after removing it.
