String::Multibyte - locale-independent manipulation
of multibyte character strings

SYNOPSIS

  use String::Multibyte
  $sjis = String::Multibyte->new('ShiftJIS');
  $sjis_length = $sjis->length($sjis_string);

DESCRIPTION

This module provides some functions which emulate
the corresponding CORE:: functions
to manipulate multiple-byte character strings.

This module uses the object-oriented syntax to tell methods
in which charset the specified strings should be handled.
