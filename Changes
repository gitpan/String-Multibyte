Revision history for Perl extension String::Multibyte.

1.03  Sun Nov 17 22:20:45 2002
    - some detypo.

1.02  Sun Nov 17 19:40:57 2002
    - add Grapheme.pm for Perl 5.8.0 or later.
    - add Big5.pm, Big5Plus.pm, EUC_TW.pm, GB18030.pm, GBK.pm, Johab.pm,
      and UHC.pm.  These encodings are not very familiar to me...
      Patches, comments, and suggestions are welcome.
    - fix: EUC_JP includes 0x8EE0..0x8EFE.
    - some new tests.

1.01  Thu Nov 14 22:35:01 2002
    - bug fix: grapheme handling for r?index() and strsplit().
    - doc fix: The repertories for EUC, EUC_JP, ShiftJIS include 0x7F (DEL).

1.00  Mon Nov 11 22:45:21 2002
    - new() can cope with a hashref (not only a module name).
    - add UTF16BE.pm and UTF16LE.pm.
    - Surrogate characters are excluded from the character order
      in String::Multibyte::UTF8. (Now the next to U+D7FF is U+E000.)
    - bug fix: strtr() did not carp even if 1st parameter is a reference
      to a malformed string, and VERBOSE is true.
    - Unicode.pm revived (only for Perl 5.8.0 or later).
      Some tests are provided for Unicode.pm.
      These tests will be skipped silently on an older Perl.

0.05  Wed Sep 12 23:23:14 2001
    - remove ::Unicode.pm, that cannot pass all the test.

0.04  Fri Sep 07 23:03:25 2001
    - bug fix: "" for length and r?index.
    - strtr returns a histogram if 'h' modifier is given.
    - add ::Unicode.pm
      that counts upon the core unicode support.
      (maybe works only on Perl 5.7 or later)

0.03  Sat Jun 16 10:40:21 2001
    - remove ^M characters from all the files.
